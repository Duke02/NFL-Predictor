# NFL Predictor

Basically an algorithm that uses graphs to figure out if a given team is going to beat another. Is it a perfect algorithm? If it works, I'll be very surprised. 

## Do I like football?

Not really. My job has us do a NFL Pick-Em league (or whatever) and I am currently in last place. I wish to do a bit better and I've had this idea this entire season, so maybe it'll work next year. Who knows? 

I will say though, having a bunch of engineers that don't watch football play a Pick-Em league is very fun. One of my coworkers picked teams based on whether she liked their mascot or not. So hopefully this algorithm is better than her way of doing it.
